## THEORY

A Zener diode is a heavily doped p–n junction diode designed to operate in the breakdown region.  
Under reverse bias, a normal diode blocks current, but when the reverse voltage reaches a certain value, the Zener diode conducts sharply. This voltage is called the **Zener breakdown voltage**.

Since the current can rise rapidly in breakdown, a series resistor is used to limit current.  
Once the diode enters breakdown, it maintains an almost constant voltage across it, regardless of current variations, due to its **low dynamic resistance**. This makes it ideal for **voltage regulation**.

## PROCEDURE

1. Connect the circuit as shown in the diagram.
2. Increase the regulated power supply in small steps.
3. Observe that the Zener voltage (Vz) remains almost constant even though Zener current (Iz) increases. This constant voltage is the reference.
4. Note the Zener current and voltage in a tabular form.
5. Plot a graph of Zener current (Iz) on the y-axis against Zener voltage (Vz) on the x-axis.

## PRECAUTIONS

1. Do not exceed the rated voltage or current of the Zener diode.  
2. Ensure correct polarity while connecting the voltmeter and ammeter.  
3. Do not switch on the supply before verifying circuit connections.
